#Database Design

Task: Design a simple database schema and ERD for a “task management” system. Each task belongs to a single user, and a user can have multiple tasks. Define your own table contents and data dictionaries for the following tables.

1. Users/Team Member

2. Projects

3. Tasks and Subtask

4. Task Type

5. Image/Video/ other documents

6. Access control by able to add, edit, delete task, user and other


Instructions:

1. Provide the SQL CREATE TABLE statements for the Users and Tasks tables what could execute in MySql.

2. Clearly define primary keys, foreign keys, and any relevant constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE, etc.).

3. Include an example INSERT statement for both tables.
